# Time-Series-HW

# A Yen for the Future


## Background

The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

In this assignment, we will test the many time-series tools that we have learned in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.


### Time-Series Forecasting

In this notebook, we will load historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data and apply time series analysis and modeling to determine whether there is any predictable behavior.


1. Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott Filter (Decompose the Settle price into trend and noise).
2. Forecasting Returns using an ARMA Model.
3. Forecasting the Settle Price using an ARIMA Model.
4. Forecasting Volatility with GARCH.

Using the results of the time series analysis and modeling, we will answer the following questions:

1. Based on the time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?


### Linear Regression Forecasting

In this notebook, we will build a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures ("settle") returns with *lagged* Yen futures returns and categorical calendar seasonal effects (e.g., day-of-week or week-of-year seasonal effects).

1. Data Preparation (Creating Returns and Lagged Returns and splitting the data into training and testing data)
2. Fitting a Linear Regression Model.
3. Making predictions using the testing data.
4. Out-of-sample performance.
5. In-sample performance.

Using the results of the linear regression analysis and modeling, we will answer the following question:

* Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?

Conclusions can be found at the bottom of each notebook.
